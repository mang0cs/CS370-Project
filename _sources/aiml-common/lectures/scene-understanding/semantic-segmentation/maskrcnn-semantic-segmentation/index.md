# MaskRCNN Semantic Segmentation

The semantic segmentation approach described in this section is [MaskRCNN based on this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) paper. 

The following notebook is the end result of the Mask RCNN implementation for object detection and semantic segmentation. Scroll down to see three other notebooks that explain how the end result was obtained. 

## Implementation and Notebooks

The four notebooks in this section use Tensorflow. For Pytorch see [Detectron2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/detection). 

* [This notebook](https://pantelis.github.io/artificial-intelligence/aiml-common/lectures/scene-understanding/semantic-segmentation/demo.ipynb) demos MaskRCNN.

* [This notebook](https://pantelis.github.io/artificial-intelligence/aiml-common/lectures/scene-understanding/semantic-segmentation/inspect_data.ipynb) visualizes the different pre-processing steps to prepare the training data.

* [This notebook](https://pantelis.github.io/artificial-intelligence/aiml-common/lectures/scene-understanding/semantic-segmentation/inspect_model.ipynb) goes in depth into the steps performed to detect and segment objects. It provides visualizations of every step of the pipeline.

* [This notebook](https://pantelis.github.io/artificial-intelligence/aiml-common/lectures/scene-understanding/semantic-segmentation/inspect_weights.ipynb) inspects the weights of a trained model and looks for anomalies and odd patterns.
