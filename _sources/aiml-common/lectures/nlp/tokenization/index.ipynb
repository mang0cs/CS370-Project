    "If this notebook seems half done, its because it is. I am still working on it. I will update it based on [this](ttps://blog.floydhub.com/tokenization-nlp) conceptual guide and [this](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tokenizer_summary) implementation guide.\n",

    "**Model fine-tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last few years we have seen the rise of pre-trained language models such as BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, etc. These models are trained on large amounts of text data and are then used to perform downstream tasks such as text classification, text generation, etc. **When you finetune a language model, you have to feed a pretrained model with the same type of tokens that it was trained on.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model training from scratch**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a language model is not available in the language you are interested in, or if your corpus is very different from the one your language model was trained on, you will most likely want to retrain the model from scratch using a tokenizer adapted to your data. That will require training a new tokenizer on your dataset. Follow [this guide](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/2?fw=pt) to learn how to do that. "

    "If you are perplexed about the `Ġ` please note that this character is what the encoder produces for the space character. The encoder code doesn't like spaces, so they replace spaces and other whitespace characters with other unicode bytes.  The encoder [more specifically](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/issues/80) takes all control and whitespace characters in code points 0-255 and shifts them up by 256 to make them printable. So space (code point 32) becomes Ġ (code point 288)."
