Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are heavily researched at present for both civilian and defense applications. You will participate in the VRX 2022 competition and immerse yourself in a virtual environment in ROS (and in the future ROS2) while at the same time learn the domain of maritime navigation. 

To navigate a robot and complete you will be implement the whole stack of an AI agent from perception to thruster control.
